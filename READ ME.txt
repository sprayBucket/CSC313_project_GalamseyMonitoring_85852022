* To run this program, the "MySQL-connector-Java" driver from MySQL must be installed on your machine and 
  should be placed in a folder called "lib" in your "src" folder
* MySQL Workbench also needs to be installed on your machine and needs to be connected to the 'localhost:3306'
  because that is what the program needs to establish a connection to the database
* The GALAMSEY.sql file included in this project needs to be run on mySQL workbench before the java programs are run
* The data.csv file included here is to test the method in the "GalamseyCsv class that creates new Galamsey objects from
  the details given in the data.csv file. The data.csv file SHOULD be placed in the same folder as the "src" and "out folders.
  Alternatively, you can put the file path of the .csv file in the java program.
